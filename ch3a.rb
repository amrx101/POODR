=begin
    An object depends on another object if, when one object changes, the other might be
forced to change in turn.
    Hereâ€™s a modified version of the Gear class, where Gear is initialized with four familiar
arguments. The gear_inches method uses two of them, rim and tire, to
create a new instance of Wheel. Wheel has not changed since you last you saw it in
Chapter 2, Designing Classes with a Single Responsibility.

class Gear
  attr_reader :chainring, :cog, :rim, :tire
  def initialize(chainring, cog, rim, tire)
    @chainring = chainring
    @cog       = cog
    @rim       = rim
    @tire      = tire
  end
  
  def gear_inches
    ratio * Wheel.new(rim, tire).diameter
  end
  
  def ratio
    chainring / cog.to_f
  end
# ...
end


class Wheel
  attr_reader :rim, :tire
  def initialize(rim, tire)
    @rim       = rim
    @tire      = tire
  end
  
  def diameter
    rim + (tire * 2)
  end
# ...
end


x = Gear.new(52, 11, 26, 1.5).gear_inches
